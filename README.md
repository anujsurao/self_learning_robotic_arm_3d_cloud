# Self-Learning Robotic Arm in 3D Grid with Cloud Integration

## Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm for a robotic arm in a 3D grid environment with comprehensive cloud integration. The robotic arm learns various tasks through user interactions and stores its knowledge in the cloud. This enables the robot to be used for diverse tasks and improves its performance over time.

## Key Features
- Deep Q-Learning (DQN): Neural network-based Q-learning for complex learning tasks.
- 3D Grid Environment: Simulate the robotic arm's movements in a 3D space.
- Cloud Integration: Store training data and learned models in the cloud for scalability.
- Versatility: Adaptable to various tasks based on user training.
- User-Friendly Interface: Web interface for interacting with the robot and visualizing its learning process.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For neural network implementation.
- Flask: Web framework.
- Plotly/Dash: For interactive visualization.
- AWS/GCP/Azure: Cloud services for data storage and computation.
- Docker: For containerization.
